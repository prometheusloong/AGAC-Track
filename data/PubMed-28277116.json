Recent studies indicated that the level of BDNF in follicular fluid is a marker for oocyte quality and infertility. Here, we intend to further investigate the function of BDNF and its signaling pathway in the regulation of endometrial cells proliferation. We found that BDNF is a critical growth factor in endometrial cells. Activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 signaling pathway is required for BNDF-regulated endometrial cell proliferation. Furthermore, BDNF is an effector of estrogen in endometrial cells. Finally, we investigated the different role of Val66Met, a single-nucleotide polymorphism of the BDNF gene, in regulating endometrial cells proliferation. The results showed that BDNF(V66M) polymorphism is a loss-of-function polymorphism in the regulation of endometrial cells growth. Given the correlation between endometriosis and infertility, it is important to understand the role of BDNF in regulating endometrial cells proliferation and to develop new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of endometriosis-related infertility.","project":"AGAC_training","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":902,"end":906},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":913,"end":925},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":931,"end":947},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":948,"end":960},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":968,"end":1006},"obj":"MPA"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R2","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T6"}]}
