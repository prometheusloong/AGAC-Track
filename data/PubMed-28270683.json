The most frequent secondary alteration, demonstrated in \u223c70% of GISTs, is chromosome 14q deletion. Here we report hemizygous or homozygous inactivating mutations of the chromosome 14q MAX gene in 16 of 76 GISTs (21%). We find MAX mutations in 17% and 50% of sporadic and NF1-syndromic GISTs, respectively, and we find loss of MAX protein expression in 48% and 90% of sporadic and NF1-syndromic GISTs, respectively, and in three of eight micro-GISTs, which are early GISTs. MAX genomic inactivation is associated with p16 silencing in the absence of p16 coding sequence deletion and MAX induction restores p16 expression and inhibits GIST proliferation. Hence, MAX inactivation is a common event in GIST progression, fostering cell cycle activity in early GISTs.","project":"AGAC_training","denotations":[{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":98,"end":101},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":103,"end":109},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":111,"end":114},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":119,"end":122},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":123,"end":132},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":166,"end":175},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":191,"end":223},"obj":"MPA"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R2","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R5","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R6","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T6"}]}
