Increased or ectopic PDGF activity may also cause or contribute to diseases such as cancer and tissue fibrosis. Until recently, no loss-of-function (LOF) mutations in PDGF or PDGF receptor genes were reported as causally linked to a human disease. This changed in 2013 when reports appeared on presumed LOF mutations in the genes encoding PDGF-B and its receptor PDGF receptor-beta (PDGF-R\u03b2) in familial idiopathic basal ganglia calcification (IBGC), a brain disease characterized by anatomically localized calcifications in or near the blood microvessels. Here, we review PDGF-B and PDGF-R\u03b2 biology with special reference to their functions in brain-blood vessel development, pericyte recruitment and the regulation of the blood-brain barrier. We also discuss various scenarios for IBGC pathogenesis suggested by observations in patients and genetically engineered animal models of the disease.","project":"AGAC_training","denotations":[{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":323,"end":330},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":331,"end":335},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":336,"end":344},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":354,"end":359},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":363,"end":373},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":394,"end":400},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":405,"end":420},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":613,"end":616},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":617,"end":626},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":649,"end":655},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":693,"end":700},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":705,"end":752},"obj":"Disease"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R10","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T10","obj":"T9"},{"id":"R11","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T12","obj":"T9"},{"id":"R12","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T13","obj":"T10"},{"id":"R2","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R3","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R4","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R5","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R6","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R7","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R8","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R9","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T11","obj":"T10"}]}
