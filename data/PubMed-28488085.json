CCMs can cause seizures, focal neurological deficits or acute intracranial hemorrhage; however, most patients are asymptomatic. CCMs occur either sporadically or as a familial autosomal-dominant disorder. We present a clinical and molecular study of a patient with distinctive cerebral and spinal cavernous malformations following radiochemotherapy for a malignant brain tumor.\nMETHODS: The patient had multiple magnet resonance imaging (MRI) examinations of his brain and spine following radiochemotherapy for a primary intracranial germ cell tumor (GCT), as part of his oncologic follow-up. The MRI sequences included susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI). The coding exons and their flanking intronic regions of KRIT1/CCM1 gene were analyzed for mutations by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and direct sequencing.\nRESULTS: MRI revealed numerous cerebral and spinal microhemorrhages and pronounced cavernous malformations that progressed with subsequent follow-up imaging. Genetic analysis demonstrated a novel heterozygous KRIT1/CCM1 two base pair deletion (c.1535_1536delTG) in exon 14. This deletion leads to a frameshift with a premature stop codon at nucleotide position 1553 and a highly likely loss of function of the KRIT1 protein.\nCONCLUSION: We describe a patient with a novel heterozygous germ line loss of function mutation in KRIT1, which is associated with rapid-onset and highly progressive CCMs after radiochemotherapy for a malignant brain tumor.","project":"AGAC_training","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":6,"end":22},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":23,"end":31},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":35,"end":40},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":49,"end":64},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":88,"end":131},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":209,"end":246},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":1355,"end":1360},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":1390,"end":1406},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":1434,"end":1442},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":1445,"end":1455},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":1463,"end":1483},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":1532,"end":1548},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":1556,"end":1569},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":1641,"end":1657},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":1658,"end":1666},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":1670,"end":1675},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":1686,"end":1701},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":1737,"end":1741},"obj":"Disease"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R10","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T13","obj":"T12"},{"id":"R11","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T15","obj":"T14"},{"id":"R12","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T16","obj":"T15"},{"id":"R13","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T15","obj":"T17"},{"id":"R14","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T18","obj":"T17"},{"id":"R2","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R3","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R5","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T9"},{"id":"R6","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T10","obj":"T9"},{"id":"R7","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T11","obj":"T9"},{"id":"R8","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R9","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T12"}]}
