Gly316Cys). In\u00a0vitro functional studies demonstrated that this mutation leads to a loss of function of PCSK9 on low-density lipoprotein receptor degradation. This patient exhibited liver steatosis; he was neither diabetic, nor obese or alcoholic, but is a carrier of 2 polymorphisms, p.Ile148Met (rs738409) and p.Glu167Lys (rs58542926) on PNPLA3 and TM6SF2 gene, respectively, previously shown to be associated with nonalcoholic steatosis and fibrosis evolution. These data suggested that if a resistance to hepatic steatosis mediated by the PCSK9 deficiency exists, as demonstrated in mice, it is not sufficient to prevent hepatic fatty accumulation in the case of genetic factors predisposing to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.","project":"AGAC_training","denotations":[{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":10,"end":29},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":34,"end":43},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":62,"end":67},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":68,"end":84},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":85,"end":93},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":301,"end":310},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":398,"end":414},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":418,"end":423},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":427,"end":471},"obj":"MPA"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R2","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R5","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T10","obj":"T9"},{"id":"R6","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T9","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R7","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T6"}]}
