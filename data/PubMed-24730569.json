We report on the DNA damage response (DDR) of human melanocytes to UV and its enhancement by \u03b1-MSH. \u03b1-MSH up-regulated the levels of XPC, the enzyme that recognizes DNA damage sites, enhanced the UV-induced phosphorylation of the DNA damage sensors ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR) and ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and their respect-ive substrates checkpoint kinases 1 and 2, and increased phosphorylated H2AX (\u03b3H2AX) formation. These effects required functional MC1R and were absent in melanocytes expressing loss of function (LOF) MC1R. The levels of wild-type p53-induced phosphatase 1 (Wip1), which dephosphorylates \u03b3H2AX, correlated inversely with \u03b3H2AX. We propose that \u03b1-MSH increases UV-induced \u03b3H2AX to facilitate formation of DNA repair complexes and repair of DNA photoproducts, and LOF of MC1R compromises the DDR and genomic stability of melanocytes.","project":"AGAC_training","denotations":[{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":1107,"end":1110},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":1114,"end":1118},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":1119,"end":1130},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":1135,"end":1138},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":1143,"end":1175},"obj":"CPA"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R2","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R7","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T9","obj":"T4"}]}
