Great progress has been made in elucidating the genetic aetiology of CHD with advances in genomic technology, which we leveraged in recovering a new pathway affecting heart development in humans previously known to affect heart development in an animal model.\nMETHODS: Four hundred and sixteen individuals from Thailand and the USA diagnosed with CHD and/or congenital diaphragmatic hernia were evaluated with chromosomal microarray and whole exome sequencing. The DECIPHER Consortium and medical literature were searched for additional patients. Murine hearts from ENU-induced mouse mutants and transgenic mice were evaluated using both episcopic confocal histopathology and troponin I stained sections.\nRESULTS: Loss of function ROBO1 variants were identified in three families; each proband had a ventricular septal defect, and one proband had tetralogy of Fallot. Additionally, a microdeletion in an individual with CHD was found in the medical literature. Mouse models showed perturbation of the Slit-Robo signalling pathway, causing septation and outflow tract defects and craniofacial anomalies. Two probands had variable facial features consistent with the mouse model.\nCONCLUSION: Our findings identify Slit-Robo as a significant pathway in human heart development and CHD.","project":"AGAC_training","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":16},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":20,"end":25},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":29,"end":39},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":45,"end":64},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":69,"end":83},"obj":"Disease"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R2","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T5"}]}
