Previously reported pathogenic gain-of-function mutations of GPCR genes invariably encoded aberrant receptors with excessive signal transduction activity. Although in vitro assays demonstrated that an artificially created inactive mutant of PROKR2 exerted paradoxical gain-of-function effects when co-transfected with wild-type proteins, such a phenomenon has not been observed in vivo. Here, we report a heterozygous frameshift mutation of PROKR2 identified in a 3.5-year-old girl with central precocious puberty. The mutant mRNA escaped nonsense-mediated decay and generated a GPCR lacking two transmembrane domains and the carboxyl-terminal tail. The mutant protein had no in vitro signal transduction activity; however, cells co-expressing the mutant and wild-type PROKR2 exhibited markedly exaggerated ligand-induced Ca(2+) responses. The results indicate that certain inactive PROKR2 mutants can cause early puberty by enhancing the functional property of coexisting wild-type proteins. Considering the structural similarity among GPCRs, this paradoxical gain-of-function mechanism may underlie various human disorders.","project":"AGAC_training","denotations":[{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":779,"end":785},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":791,"end":798},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":799,"end":822},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":844,"end":851},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":852,"end":877},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":1143,"end":1149},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":1150,"end":1157},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":1185,"end":1194},"obj":"PosReg"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":1199,"end":1251},"obj":"MPA"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R2","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R3","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T9"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T10","obj":"T9"},{"id":"R5","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T11","obj":"T12"},{"id":"R6","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T12","obj":"T13"},{"id":"R7","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T14","obj":"T13"}]}
