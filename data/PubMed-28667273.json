In tomato, pedicel abscission is an important agronomic factor that controls yield and post-harvest fruit quality. Two non-allelic mutations, jointless (j) and jointless-2 (j-2), controlling pedicel abscission zone formation have been documented but only j-2 has been extensively used in breeding. J was shown to encode a MADS-box protein. Using a combination of physical mapping and gene expression analysis we identified a positional candidate, Solyc12g038510, associated with j-2 phenotype. Targeted knockout of Solyc12g038510, using CRISPR/Cas9 system, validated our hypothesis. Solyc12g038510 encodes the MADS-box protein SlMBP21. Molecular analysis of j-2 natural variation revealed two independent loss-of-function mutants. The first results of an insertion of a Rider retrotransposable element. The second results of a stop codon mutation that leads to a truncated protein form. To bring new insights into the role of J and J-2 in abscission zone formation, we phenotyped the single and the double mutants and the engineered alleles. We showed that J is epistatic to J-2 and that the branched inflorescences and the leafy sepals observed in accessions harboring j-2 alleles are likely the consequences of linkage drags.","project":"AGAC_training","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":20,"end":36},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":37,"end":46},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":50,"end":57},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":79,"end":100},"obj":"CPA"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R2","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T1"}]}
