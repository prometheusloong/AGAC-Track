During this period, gefitinib was the only EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor reimbursed by the Bureau of National Health Insurance of Taiwan.\nRESULTS: The median progression-free survival and median OS were 11.9 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 9.7-14.2) and 26.9 months (21.2-32.5), respectively. The Cox proportional hazards regression model revealed that postoperative recurrence, performance status (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Grade [ECOG] \u22652), smoking index (\u226520 pack-years), liver metastasis at initial diagnosis, and chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection were independent prognostic factors for OS (hazard ratio [95% CI] 0.3 [0.11-0.83], p\u2009=\u2009.02; 2.69 [1.60-4.51], p\u2009\u003C\u2009.001; 1.92 [1.24-2.97], p\u2009=\u2009.003; 2.26 [1.34-3.82], p\u2009=\u2009.002; 3.38 [1.85-7.78], p\u2009\u003C\u2009.001, respectively). However, brain metastasis (BM) at initial diagnosis or intracranial progression during gefitinib treatment had no impact on OS (1.266 [0.83-1.93], p\u2009=\u2009.275 and 0.75 [0.48-1.19], p\u2009=\u2009.211, respectively).\nCONCLUSION: HCV infection, performance status (ECOG \u22652), newly diagnosed advanced NSCLC without prior operation, and liver metastasis predicted poor OS in EGFR mutation-positive advanced NSCLC patients treated with first-line gefitinib; however, neither BM at initial diagnosis nor intracranial progression during gefitinib treatment had an impact on OS. The Oncologist 2017;22:1-9 IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The finding that chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection might predict poor overall survival (OS) in epidermal growth factor receptor mutation-positive advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients treated with first-line gefitinib may raise awareness of benefit from anti-HCV treatment in this patient population. Brain metastasis in the initial diagnosis or intracranial progression during gefitinib treatment is not a prognostic factor for OS. This study, which enrolled a real-world population of NSCLC patients, including sicker patients who were not eligible for a clinical trial, may have impact on guiding usual clinical practice.","project":"AGAC_training","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":62,"end":66},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":67,"end":75},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":76,"end":84},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":94,"end":120},"obj":"Disease"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R2","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T4"}]}
