Common mutant p53 (mutp53) isoforms can actively promote cancer through gain-of-function (GOF) mechanisms. We report that mutp53 prolongs TNF-\u03b1-induced NF-\u03baB activation in cultured cells and intestinal organoid cultures. Remarkably, when exposed to dextran sulfate sodium, mice harboring a germline p53 mutation develop severe chronic inflammation and persistent tissue damage, and are highly prone to inflammation-associated colon cancer. This mutp53 GOF is manifested by rapid onset of flat dysplastic lesions that progress to invasive carcinoma with mutp53 accumulation and augmented NF-\u03baB activation, faithfully recapitulating features frequently observed in human colitis-associated colorectal cancer (CAC). These findings might explain the early appearance of p53 mutations in human CAC.","project":"AGAC_training","denotations":[{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":699,"end":707},"obj":"PosReg"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":711,"end":729},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":735,"end":741},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":742,"end":754},"obj":"PosReg"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":769,"end":774},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":775,"end":785},"obj":"PosReg"},{"id":"T24","span":{"begin":851,"end":887},"obj":"Disease"}],"relations":[{"id":"R13","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T20","obj":"T21"},{"id":"R14","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T22","obj":"T23"},{"id":"R15","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T23","obj":"T17"},{"id":"R16","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T19","obj":"T17"},{"id":"R17","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T21","obj":"T17"},{"id":"R20","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T20","obj":"T23"},{"id":"R21","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T24","obj":"T17"}]}
