Herein we have systematically characterized two novel loss-of-function mutations in LPL from a Chinese family in which afflicted members were manifested by severe hypertriglyceridemia and recurrent pancreatitis. DNA sequencing revealed that the proband was a heterozygote carrying a novel c.T928C (p.C310R) mutation in exon 6 of the LPL gene. Another member of the family was detected to be a compound heterozygote who along with the c.T928C mutation also carried a novel missense mutation c.A1187T (p.E396V) in exon 8 of the LPL gene. Furthermore, COS-1 cells were transfected with lentiviruses containing the mutant LPL genes. While C310R markedly reduced the overall LPL protein level, COS-1 cells carrying E396V or double mutations contained similar overall LPL protein levels to the wild-type. The specific activity of the LPL mutants remained at comparable magnitude to the wild-type. However, few LPL were detected in the culture medium for the mutants, suggesting that both mutations caused aberrant triglyceride catabolism. More specifically, E396V and double mutations dampened the transport of LPL to the cell surface, while for the C310R mutation, reducing LPL protein level might be involved. By characterizing these two novel LPL mutations, this study has expanded our understanding on the pathogenesis of familial hypertriglyceridemia (FHTG).","project":"AGAC_training","denotations":[{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":7,"end":27},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":45,"end":61},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":62,"end":80},"obj":"Enzyme"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":97,"end":102},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":103,"end":108},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":130,"end":145},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":146,"end":174},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":967,"end":972},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":982,"end":989},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":1002,"end":1019},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":1314,"end":1323},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":1324,"end":1330},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":1340,"end":1363},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":1384,"end":1389},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":1394,"end":1410},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":1411,"end":1419},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":1424,"end":1460},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":1476,"end":1481},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":1492,"end":1500},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":1501,"end":1518},"obj":"MPA"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R10","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T12","obj":"T13"},{"id":"R11","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T14","obj":"T13"},{"id":"R12","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T15","obj":"T17"},{"id":"R13","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T16","obj":"T17"},{"id":"R14","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T18","obj":"T17"},{"id":"R15","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T19","obj":"T20"},{"id":"R16","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T21","obj":"T20"},{"id":"R2","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R3","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R4","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R5","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R6","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R7","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R8","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T9","obj":"T10"},{"id":"R9","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T11","obj":"T10"}]}
