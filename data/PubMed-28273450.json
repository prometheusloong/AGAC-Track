In this study, we identify a subset of human melanomas that have loss-of-function mutations in ATR, a kinase that recognizes and repairs UV-induced DNA damage and is required for cellular proliferation. ATR mutant tumors exhibit both the accumulation of multiple mutations and the altered expression of inflammatory genes, resulting in decreased T\u00a0cell recruitment and increased recruitment of macrophages known to spur tumor invasion. Taken together, these studies identify a mechanism by which melanoma cells modulate the immune microenvironment to promote continued growth.","project":"AGAC_training","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":3},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":4,"end":13},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":14,"end":21},"obj":"PosReg"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":26,"end":32},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":36,"end":51},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":133,"end":142},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":166,"end":174},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":175,"end":186},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":200,"end":208},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":213,"end":259},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":464,"end":467},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":468,"end":474},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":597,"end":606},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":607,"end":625},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":630,"end":639},"obj":"PosReg"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":640,"end":666},"obj":"MPA"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R10","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T12","obj":"T13"},{"id":"R11","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T14","obj":"T13"},{"id":"R12","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T12","obj":"T15"},{"id":"R13","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T16","obj":"T15"},{"id":"R2","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R5","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R6","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R7","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T9"},{"id":"R8","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T10","obj":"T9"},{"id":"R9","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T11","obj":"T12"}]}
