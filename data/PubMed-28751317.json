However, it is unclear how OsHRZ1 transmits signals. In this study, we reveal that OsPRI1 interacts with OsHRZ1. A loss-of-function mutation to OsPRI1 increased the sensitivity of plants to Fe-deficient conditions and downregulated the expression of Fe-deficiency-responsive genes. Yeast one-hybrid and electrophoretic mobility shift assay results suggested that OsPRI1 binds to the OsIRO2 and OsIRO3 promoters. In vitro ubiquitination experiments indicated that OsPRI1 is ubiquitinated by OsHRZ1. Cell-free degradation assays revealed that the stability of OsPRI1 decreased in wild type roots, but increased in the hrz1-2 mutant, suggesting OsHRZ1 is responsible for the instability of OsPRI1. The hrz1-2 seedlings were insensitive to Fe-deficient conditions. When the pri1-1 mutation was introduced into hrz1-2 mutants, the pri1hrz1 double mutant was more sensitive to Fe deficiency than the hrz1-2 mutant. Additionally, the expression levels of Fe-deficiency-responsive genes were lower in the hrz1pri1 double mutant than in the hrz1-2 mutant. Collectively, these results imply that OsPRI1, which is ubiquitinated by OsHRZ1, mediates rice responses to Fe-deficiency by positively regulating OsIRO2 and OsIRO3 expression as part of the OsHRZ1-OsPRI1-OsIRO2/3 signal transduction cascade.","project":"AGAC_training","denotations":[{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":255,"end":271},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":272,"end":280},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":284,"end":290},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":291,"end":300},"obj":"PosReg"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":305,"end":353},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":358,"end":371},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":376,"end":420},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":685,"end":694},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":739,"end":748},"obj":"PosReg"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":756,"end":762},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":763,"end":769},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":910,"end":916},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":917,"end":925},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":930,"end":940},"obj":"Interaction"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":946,"end":952},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":953,"end":960},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":993,"end":997},"obj":"PosReg"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":998,"end":1024},"obj":"MPA"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R10","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T13","obj":"T14"},{"id":"R11","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T14","obj":"T15"},{"id":"R12","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T17","obj":"T15"},{"id":"R13","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T16","obj":"T17"},{"id":"R14","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T16","obj":"T15"},{"id":"R15","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T17","obj":"T18"},{"id":"R16","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T19","obj":"T18"},{"id":"R2","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R3","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R5","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R6","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R7","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T10","obj":"T11"},{"id":"R8","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T11","obj":"T9"},{"id":"R9","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T12","obj":"T9"}]}
