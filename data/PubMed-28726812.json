We describe a 10-year-old child with a germ-line PDGFRB p.N666H mutation who responded to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib by inhibition of PDGFRB.MethodsThe impact of p.N666H on PDGFRB function and sensitivity to imatinib was studied in cell culture.ResultsCells expressing the p.N666H mutation showed constitutive PDGFRB tyrosine phosphorylation. PDGF-independent proliferation was abolished by imatinib at 1\u2009\u03bcM concentration. Patient fibroblasts showed constitutive receptor tyrosine phosphorylation that was also abrogated by imatinib with reduced proliferation of treated cells.This led to patient treatment with imatinib at 400\u2009mg daily (340\u2009mg/m(2)) for a year with objective improvement of debilitating hand and foot contractures, reduced facial coarseness, and significant improvement in quality of life. New small subcutaneous nodules developed, but remained stable. Transient leukopenia, neutropenia, and fatigue resolved without intervention; however, mildly decreased growth velocity resulted in reducing imatinib dose to 200\u2009mg daily (170\u2009mg/m(2)). The patient continues treatment with ongoing clinical response.ConclusionTo our knowledge, this is one of the first personalized treatments of a congenital disorder caused by a germ-line PDGF receptor mutation with a PDGFRB inhibitor.GENETICS in MEDICINE advance online publication, 20 July 2017; doi:10.1038/gim.2017.104.","project":"AGAC_training","denotations":[{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":149,"end":158},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":162,"end":168},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":169,"end":174},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":175,"end":205},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":210,"end":225},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":276,"end":282},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":283,"end":290},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":304,"end":355},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":359,"end":369},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":373,"end":379},"obj":"Gene"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R2","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R4","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R5","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T11"},{"id":"R6","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R7","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T9","obj":"T11"},{"id":"R8","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T10","obj":"T11"}]}
