Upon activation by \u03b1-melanocyte stimulating hormone, MC1R triggers the cAMP cascade to stimulate eumelanogenesis. We used whole-exome sequencing to identify causative alleles in Pakistani families with skin and hair hypopigmentation. Six MC1R mutations segregated with the phenotype in seven families, including a p.Val174del in-frame deletion and a p.Tyr298* nonsense mutation, that were analyzed for function in heterologous HEK293 cells. p.Tyr298* MC1R showed no agonist-induced signaling to the cAMP or ERK pathways, nor detectable agonist binding. Conversely, signaling was comparable for p.Val174del and wild-type in HEK cells overexpressing the proteins, but binding analysis suggested impaired cell surface expression. Flow cytometry and confocal imaging studies revealed reduced plasma membrane expression of p.Val174del and p.Tyr298*. Therefore, p.Tyr298* was a total loss-of-function (LOF) allele, while p.Val174del displayed a partial LOF attribute.","project":"AGAC_training","denotations":[{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":727,"end":736},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":737,"end":741},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":749,"end":751},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":752,"end":777},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":785,"end":789},"obj":"Pathway"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":793,"end":805},"obj":"Pathway"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":807,"end":810},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":822,"end":837},"obj":"Interaction"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":880,"end":891},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":979,"end":987},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":988,"end":1011},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":1066,"end":1073},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":1074,"end":1100},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":1104,"end":1115},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":1120,"end":1129},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":1142,"end":1151},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":1164,"end":1180},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":1201,"end":1212},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":1225,"end":1236},"obj":"NegReg"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R10","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T14","obj":"T13"},{"id":"R11","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T15","obj":"T13"},{"id":"R12","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T16","obj":"T13"},{"id":"R13","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T17","obj":"T18"},{"id":"R14","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T19","obj":"T20"},{"id":"R2","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R3","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T8"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T9","obj":"T8"},{"id":"R5","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R6","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R7","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R8","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T10","obj":"T11"},{"id":"R9","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T12","obj":"T11"}]}
