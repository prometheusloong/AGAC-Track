However, detailed analyses conclusively confirming these variants, as well as the underlying molecular mechanisms explaining the diseases, are often lacking. Here, we report on an ID syndrome caused by de novo heterozygous loss-of-function (LoF) mutations in SON. The syndrome is characterized by ID and/or DD, malformations of the cerebral cortex, epilepsy, vision problems, musculoskeletal abnormalities, and congenital malformations. Knockdown of son in zebrafish resulted in severe malformation of the spine, brain, and eyes. Importantly, analyses of RNA from affected individuals revealed that genes critical for neuronal migration and cortex organization (TUBG1, FLNA, PNKP, WDR62, PSMD3, and\u00a0HDAC6) and metabolism (PCK2, PFKL, IDH2, ACY1, and ADA) are significantly downregulated because of the accumulation of mis-spliced transcripts resulting from erroneous SON-mediated RNA splicing. Our data highlight SON as a master regulator governing neurodevelopment and demonstrate the importance of SON-mediated RNA splicing in human development.","project":"AGAC_training","denotations":[{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":8,"end":17},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":21,"end":24},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":103,"end":110},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":114,"end":146},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":562,"end":573},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":605,"end":621},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":628,"end":637},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":641,"end":644},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":1000,"end":1018},"obj":"CPA"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":1023,"end":1042},"obj":"CPA"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":1092,"end":1102},"obj":"CPA"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":1155,"end":1168},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":1184,"end":1196},"obj":"PosReg"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":1239,"end":1274},"obj":"Var"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R10","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T11","obj":"T14"},{"id":"R11","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T13","obj":"T12"},{"id":"R2","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R4","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T10","obj":"T9"},{"id":"R5","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T9","obj":"T8"},{"id":"R6","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T8"},{"id":"R7","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T8"},{"id":"R8","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T8"},{"id":"R9","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T12","obj":"T14"}]}
