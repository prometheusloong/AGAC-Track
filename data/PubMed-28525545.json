The repeat resides in an encoded region of the gene resulting in polyglutamine (polyQ) expansion which has been assumed to result in gain of function, predominantly, for the ATXN2 protein. We evaluated temporal cerebellar expression profiles by RNA sequencing of ATXN2Q127 mice vs wildtype littermates. ATXN2Q127 mice are characterized by a progressive motor phenotype onset, and have progressive cerebellar molecular and neurophysiological (Purkinje cell firing frequency) phenotypes. Our analysis revealed previously uncharacterized early and progressive abnormal patterning of cerebellar gene expression. Weighted Gene Coexpression Network Analysis (WGCNA) revealed four gene modules that were significantly correlated with disease status, composed primarily of genes associated with GTPase signaling, calcium signaling, and cell death. Of these genes, few overlapped with differentially expressed cerebellar genes that we identified in Atxn2-/- knockout mice vs wildtype littermates, suggesting that loss-of-function is not a significant component of disease pathology. We conclude that SCA2 is a disease characterized by gain of function for ATXN2.","project":"AGAC_training","denotations":[{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":104,"end":133},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":192,"end":201},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":202,"end":222},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":230,"end":235},"obj":"Gene"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R2","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T4"}]}
