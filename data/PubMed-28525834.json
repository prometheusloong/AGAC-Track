Up to 10% of Europeans and Asians carry filaggrin gene (FLG) loss-of function mutations that appear to facilitate trans-epidermal penetration of certain chemicals. We previously showed that mutation carriers have higher internal exposure to certain phthalates, compared to controls, and hypothesized that they could have increased trans-epidermal penetration of other chemicals.\nOBJECTIVES: We investigated exposure to non-persistent chemicals in young Danish men with and without FLG mutations.\nMETHODS: Concentrations of eight simple phenols, six parabens and nine UV filters were analysed in urine from 65 FLG loss-of-function mutation carriers and 130 non-carriers (controls). Regression analyses, controlling for urinary dilution and confounders, were performed to estimate associations between FLG mutation status and chemical concentrations in urine.\nRESULTS: FLG mutation carriers had 80% (13-180%) higher urinary concentrations of methyl paraben (MeP) and 91% (13-219%) higher concentrations of n-propyl paraben (n-PrP) than controls. For 13 compounds, levels were higher in FLG mutation carriers, although differences were only statistically significant for MeP and n-PrP. Combined statistical analysis of concentrations of all the 18 compounds that were detectable in \u003E10% of subjects, suggested that concentrations were generally higher in mutation carriers (p=0.03).\nCONCLUSION: FLG loss-of-function mutation carriers have a higher internal exposure to some non-persistent chemicals, independently of atopic dermatitis. This may be due to increased trans-epidermal absorption and/or higher exposure, and mutation carriers may constitute a group susceptible to increased absorption of chemicals and topical medication.","project":"AGAC_training","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":304,"end":307},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":309,"end":325},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":326,"end":335},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":351,"end":361},"obj":"PosReg"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":362,"end":410},"obj":"CPA"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R2","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R4","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T3"}]}
