Loss-of-function mutations in the human PIEZO1 gene cause autosomal recessive congenital lymphatic dysplasia. Gain-of-function mutations in the human PIEZO1 gene cause the autosomal dominant hemolytic anemia, hereditary xerocytosis (also known as dehydrated stomatocytosis). Loss-of-function mutations in the human PIEZO2 gene cause an autosomal recessive syndrome of muscular atrophy with perinatal respiratory distress, arthrogryposis, and scoliosis. Gain-of-function mutations in the human PIEZO2 gene cause three clinical types of autosomal dominant distal arthrogryposis. This chapter will review the hereditary diseases caused by mutations in the PIEZO genes\u00a0and will discuss additional physiological systems in which PIEZO channel dysfunction may contribute to human disease pathophysiology.","project":"AGAC_training","denotations":[{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":194,"end":210},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":211,"end":220},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":234,"end":240},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":252,"end":302},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":304,"end":320},"obj":"PosReg"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":321,"end":330},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":344,"end":350},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":366,"end":401},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":403,"end":425},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":441,"end":466},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":469,"end":485},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":486,"end":495},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":509,"end":515},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":530,"end":578},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":616,"end":630},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":636,"end":645},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":647,"end":663},"obj":"PosReg"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":664,"end":673},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":687,"end":693},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":729,"end":769},"obj":"Disease"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R11","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T9","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R12","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T19","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R13","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T13","obj":"T11"},{"id":"R14","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T14","obj":"T11"},{"id":"R15","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T15","obj":"T11"},{"id":"R16","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T20","obj":"T17"},{"id":"R17","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T21","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R18","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T22","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R2","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R4","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R5","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T10","obj":"T12"},{"id":"R6","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T12","obj":"T11"},{"id":"R7","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T16","obj":"T18"},{"id":"R8","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T18","obj":"T17"}]}
