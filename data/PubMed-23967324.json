In spite of growing evidence that gain-of-function (GOF) mutations of p53 also have oncogenic activity, little is known about the clinical relevance of these mutations.\nMETHODS: The clinicopathological features of high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGS-OvCa) patients with GOF p53 mutations were evaluated according to a comprehensive somatic mutation profile comprised of whole exome sequencing, mRNA expression, and protein expression profiles obtained from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).\nRESULTS: Patients with a mutant p53 protein (mutp53) with a GOF mutation showed higher p53 mRNA and protein expression levels than patients with p53 mutation with no evidence of GOF (NE-GOF). GOF mutations were more likely to occur within mutational hotspots, and at CpG sites, and resulted in mutp53 with higher functional severity (FS) scores. Clinically, patients with GOF mutations showed a higher frequency of platinum resistance (22/58, 37.9%) than patients with NE-GOF mutations (12/56, 21.4%) (p=0.054). Furthermore, patients with GOF mutations were more likely to develop distant metastasis (36/55, 65.5%) than local recurrence (19/55, 34.5%), whereas patients with NE-GOF mutations showed a higher frequency of locoregional recurrence (26/47, 55.3%) than distant metastasis (21/47, 44.7%) (p=0.035). There were no differences in overall or progression-free survival between patients with GOF or NE-GOF mutp53.\nCONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that patient with GOF mutp53 is characterized by a greater likelihood of platinum treatment resistance and distant metastatic properties in HGS-OvCa.","project":"AGAC_training","denotations":[{"id":"T33","span":{"begin":22,"end":38},"obj":"PosReg"},{"id":"T32","span":{"begin":39,"end":48},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T34","span":{"begin":52,"end":55},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T35","span":{"begin":59,"end":94},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T26","span":{"begin":283,"end":299},"obj":"PosReg"},{"id":"T27","span":{"begin":306,"end":315},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T28","span":{"begin":319,"end":322},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T29","span":{"begin":333,"end":351},"obj":"CPA"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":775,"end":786},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":807,"end":815},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":823,"end":829},"obj":"PosReg"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":830,"end":868},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":1119,"end":1128},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":1138,"end":1144},"obj":"PosReg"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":1158,"end":1177},"obj":"CPA"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":1286,"end":1295},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":1316,"end":1323},"obj":"PosReg"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":1324,"end":1342},"obj":"CPA"},{"id":"T31","span":{"begin":1717,"end":1720},"obj":"PosReg"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":1721,"end":1727},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":1750,"end":1757},"obj":"PosReg"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":1772,"end":1801},"obj":"CPA"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":1806,"end":1835},"obj":"CPA"},{"id":"T30","span":{"begin":1839,"end":1847},"obj":"Disease"}],"relations":[{"id":"R12","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T13","obj":"T14"},{"id":"R13","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T15","obj":"T14"},{"id":"R14","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T16","obj":"T17"},{"id":"R15","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T18","obj":"T17"},{"id":"R18","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T28","obj":"T27"},{"id":"R19","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T27","obj":"T26"},{"id":"R20","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T29","obj":"T26"},{"id":"R21","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T19","obj":"T31"},{"id":"R22","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T30","obj":"T31"},{"id":"R23","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T34","obj":"T32"},{"id":"R24","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T32","obj":"T33"},{"id":"R25","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T35","obj":"T33"},{"id":"R4","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T19","obj":"T20"},{"id":"R5","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T21","obj":"T20"},{"id":"R6","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T22","obj":"T20"},{"id":"R7","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R8","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T8"},{"id":"R9","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T9","obj":"T8"}]}
